# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Introduction
This project detects **credit card fraud** transactions using ML classification models.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset contains transaction details with fraud/non-fraud labels.
- Highly imbalanced dataset, handled with resampling techniques.

## ⚙️ Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE/Undersampling)  
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
4. Model Evaluation  

## 📈 Results
- Model detects fraudulent transactions with high recall.  
- Balanced accuracy achieved using resampling.  

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
git clone <repo-link>
cd credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
jupyter notebook credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_.ipynb
